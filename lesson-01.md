## What is react?

React describes itself as: 

> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

React is based on Functional Reactive programming. 

In a nutshell Reactive programming is programming with Event Streams. 

An Event Stream is like an Array of events, or things that can happen. Arrays map things out in space. Event streams map things out in time. 

React uses Reactive Programming to create a front end architecture that updates and reacts to streams of events as they occur in time. 

React is built two core features: Components, and Virtual DOM. 

### Components 

Components encapsulate their own state and update their view based on incoming data. 

Components represent both functionality and a view which is DOM representation of the component. 

What you need to know: 

- React Projects are built from components
- Most of your work with React will be writing components. 
- Components can be nested one with in another. 
- Components are objects that instantiates and reused as needed. 
- Components encapsulate both logic (methods and code), state (properties), and a view (components render themselves)

### Virtual DOM 

Updating the DOM is a slow opperation. To speed this up React creates a virtual DOM. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster than manipulating the DOM directly. 

Making changes to the virtual DOM has no effect on the actual DOM. React handles updating the real DOM with a diffing algorithm that finds and updates only the things that have changed since the last update. 

What you need to know: 

- React keeps track of all components in the virtual DOM.
- Making changes to DOM directly doe not work with React! 
- To manipulating the DOM within a React project should almost always be handled with a Component

Read more about the virtual DOM [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html).

## Getting Started

- Install Create React App 
- Make a component 
- Working with JSX 
- ES6 modules import from and export and default
- Nesting Components 
- Get started on Tutorial
	- https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
	- Make a Repo for the tutorial
	- Post a link to the repo in the tracker
	- This should be completed By class 2
	- Time spent 3 hours
