# FEW 1.2 - Lesson 2

# React iterating with keys 

Often you'll want to render a collection of JSX elements. React will automatically render a collection without you having to write a loop to do the work. 

To generate a collection JSX elements you'll usually start with a collection of other data. You'll want to transform data of one type into data of another type.

## Functional Programming 

Functional programming is a paradigm or style of programming based on functions. This is different from Object Oriented Programming which based around Objects, or precedural programming which is based on prcedures.  

It's hard to put functional programming into a nushell explanation other than to say it's all about making programs built from functions. 

The entry point for most to the world of functional programming are the Array methods: map, filter, and reduce. 

### map, filter, reduce

Array map, transforms an array of data into new data. With map you should have a one to relationship with the source array. Use it to convert an array of one type into an array of another type. 

Array filter, filter returns an array containing none, some, or all of the elements from the source array. Use it to filter the contents of an array. 

Array reduce, reduces converts an array into a single value. It takes many values and returns an aggregate value. 

## Using Array.map 

- make an array of components 

## Using Array.filter

- filter the array and make components

## Using Array.reduce

- Reduce data to display the total
