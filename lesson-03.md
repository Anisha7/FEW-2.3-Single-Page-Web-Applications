# FEW 1.2 - Lesson 3

# React API app 

Use React with a web API. 

Input pattern, and forms with React.

## Input Pattern 

- Controlled Components 
	- https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html
- React uses a special pattern for input elements 
	- This is due to the virtual DOM

## Conditionally Rendering Components

- Pattern 1 - function returns component based on props. 
- Pattern 2 - render a variable set to a component based on props or state.
- Pattern 3 = in if statement using && or ternary
- Pattern 4 - prevent component from rendering using null

## Using Fetch

- fetch
	- CORS
	- Promise
