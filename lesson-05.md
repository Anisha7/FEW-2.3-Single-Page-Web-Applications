# FEW 1.2 - Lesson 5

The goal this week is to set up and express server to work with React. This week you will build the server and define it's API. 

## Introduction

Single Page Applications run in the browser. You'll often want to use your Single Page Applications to communicate with a server. Servers provide data and act as a hub for client applications.

The goal of this week is creating a simple server to connect to your SPA front end. 

## Express 

Express is a framework that runs on a Node.js server. Express describes itself as: 

> Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. 

Let's take that apart. Express is leaves a lot of the work of creating the server to you, it doesn't provide premade systems for for tackling big problems. Instead it provides a set tools you can use to solve your problems. 

The servers you create act as services for the applications that connect to them. The language of this communication is the API.

Your goal this week is create a simple API. 

**Discussion:** 

- What is an API?
- What APIs have you worked with? 
- What does an API look like? 

## Creating APIs

Your goal is to create a service with an API. 

> In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

The API makes features and data from the service available to any front end application that connects with it.

I'm sure you've worked with APIs by now. Well written APIs help you get more done at a higher quality. Poorly written APIs can make your work more difficult and your products less capable than you envision. 

**Dsicussion:** What makes a good API? 

## Getting Started

The goal this week is to create an Express server with an API that returns JSON data. Later you will connect this service to a React client. 

### Start Express project

- install 
- run

### Testing the API

- Make some calls
- view the JSON response

### Unit testing 

- Install Mocha and Chai
- Add "test": "mocha" to package.json
- Write some tests 

## After Class

- Complete the challenges in the [React Expres Server](https://github.com/Product-College-Labs/react-express-server) Demo project.
