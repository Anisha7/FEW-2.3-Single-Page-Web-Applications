# FEW 2.3 Final Assessment

Your goal is to create a React application that displays ??? components. 

## Question 1 - 

Create a boiler plate React Project. I should be able to run this project with `npm start`.

Name your project `<final>-<first>-<last>`

## Question 2 - 

Displays a title with your name. This component should take a prop that sets the text of the title. 

## Questions 3 - 

Cookie clicker component. Your component should dipslay a count and have a button that increases the count by 1 with each click of the button. 

Use your title component to display the count. 

## Question 4 - 

A component that uses the Star Wars API. You need one text input that allows me to enter a number and a button to submit. Your component should display the name of a Star Wars character. 

https://swapi.co/api/people/<number>/

For example: 

https://swapi.co/api/people/1/

Displays Luke Skywalker in a title component. 

## Extra Credit - 

Display more info from the Star Wars API. This could be: 

- homeworld
- films
- species 
- etc. 

## Extra Credit - 

Set up as much of Redux as you can. Use this to handle the Cookie Clicker.
